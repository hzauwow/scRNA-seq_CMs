A comprehensive single-cell reference using published snRNA-seq datasets for ACM, DCM, HCM, and ICM to explore the commonalities and distinctions in cellular landscapes and intercellular communication networks across various cardiomyopathy subtypes

Background:

Cardiomyopathy encompasses a diverse range of conditions defined by extensive heterogeneity at the molecular level, including variations in cell types, gene pathways, and intercellular interactions. Understanding the common and unique aspects of these molecular features is crucial for advancing targeted treatments. We analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from the ven-tricular regions of patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardio-myopathy (HCM), and healthy donors (HD), as well as ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), conducting analyses on cell type-specific disease preferences, differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and cell-cell communication. We observed that inflamma-tory, autoimmune, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and fibrotic extracellular matrix deposition pathways are consistently en-riched across all four disease subtypes, underscoring their universal significance in disease progression. Additionally, sub-type-specific pathways were identified: arrhythmia-associated pathways in ACM, chronic inflammation-related pathways in DCM, ECM remodeling pathways in HCM, and ischemic injury and recovery pathways in ICM. These findings highlight the shared molecular features and the distinct pathogenic mechanisms characterizing each cardiomyopathy subtype. Consequently, this underscores the potential for personalized treatments targeting the specific pathophysiological processes in ACM, DCM, HCM, and ICM.
